# Data Indexing service

Service that consumes geospatial data streams and pushes each feature/record to an indexing service.

This is not a metadata harvester, but a data indexing service aiming at providing
an API to data visualization client applications in the form of streaming
data-points.

The implementation is based on a functional programming style (see [Spring Cloud Function](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-function/docs/current/reference/html/spring-cloud-function.html)).

As such, the overall functionality is decomposed using high level constructs and `Supplier<>`, `Function<>`, and `Consumer<>` abstractions,
allowing the implementation of data producer, data transformation, and destination targets as individual and composable components, agnostic of
the execution environment and deployment platforms.

This means that these data streaming processing functions could be deployed as a standalone HTTP service, as cloud native functions in a
FASS (Function As a Service) provider, used as a regular Java library, etc. 

The origin and destination of the streams of data to compose the processing pipeline are also dependant on the execution environment rather
than hard coded, meaning data may come from files, HTTP POST request bodies, a cloud message broker such as an AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol)
or Kafka streams, and so on.

The following functions are currently exposed as reactive HTTP endpoints:

* `readAll(URI):Flux<GeodataRecord>`: Reads all datasets from a URI (WFS, Shapefile, GeoPackage) and returns a reactive stream of data records
* `read(DataQuery):Flux<GeodataRecord>`: Takes a query (allows to finer grained filtering than just dataset URI) and returns a reactive stream of data records
* `toWgs84(Flux<GeodataRecord>):Flux<GeodataRecord>`: Processes a stream of data records, reprojecting their geometries to WGS84
* `index(Flux<GeodataRecord>):void` Consumer a stream of data records and sends them to an indexing service

## Quick start:

From the root of the maven project:

```
docker compose up -d
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local
```

* Read a Shapefile from a remote location:

```
curl -i -H "Content-Type: text/plain" localhost:10000/readAll -d  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geoserver/geoserver/main/data/release/data/sf/roads.shp
```

* Read a Shapefile from a remote location, and transform it to WGS84:

```
curl -i -H "Content-Type: text/plain" localhost:10000/readAll,toWgs84 -d  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geoserver/geoserver/main/data/release/data/sf/roads.shp
```
> Note the endpoint `/readAll,toWgs84` means call the `readAll` function and pipe its output through `toWgs84`

* Read a Shapefile from a remote location, transform it to WGS84, and index all its records:

```
curl -i -H "Content-Type: text/plain" localhost:10000/readAll,toWgs84,index -d  https://wms.ign.gob.ar/geoserver/ows?service=wfs
```

* Index all FeatureTypes in a remote WFS service:

```
curl -i -H "Content-Type: text/plain" localhost:10000/readAll,toWgs84,index -d  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geoserver/geoserver/main/data/release/data/sf/roads.shp
```

* Index a specific FeatureType from a remote WFS service:

```
curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:10000/read,toWgs84,index -d '{
  "uri" : "https://wms.ign.gob.ar/geoserver/ows?service=wfs",
  "layerName" : "ign:area_protegida"
}'
```

## Build

```
mvn clean install -Dcheckstyle.skip
```

> Using `-Dcheckstyle.skip` until figuring out how to apply a code formatter that'll make checkstyle happy

## Running

### Docker-compose

Using the `docker-compose.yml` composition at the project's root folder:

Either just run the whole composition:

```
docker-compose up -d data-indexer gateway
```

Or this app's required services:

```
docker-compose up -d data-indexer gateway
```

Note the `gateway` service is not required, but useful to test the API through the reverse proxy instead of hitting the internal service URL's directly.

### Local/debug launch

Make sure the services it depends on are running. From the root project directory:

```
docker-compose up -d config rabbitmq elasticsearch
```

```
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local
```

Or the equivalent application launch configuration from the IDE (for example, running the `org.fao.geonet.dataviz.indexing.DatavizIndexingApp`
as a regular Java application with the `-Dspring.profiles.active=local` JVM argument).


## Usage

> In the following API example calls, use `http://localhost:9900/dataviz/index` as the base URL if running the
docker composition (as proxied by the gateway service), or `http://localhost:10000` if running locally 
(e.g. from `mvn spring-boot:run` or the IDE).
